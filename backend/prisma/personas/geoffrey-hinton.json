      "summary": "Geoffrey Hinton is a British-Canadian cognitive psychologist and computer scientist widely regarded as the 'Godfather of Deep Learning.' After decades of pioneering work on neural networks and backpropagation when the field was deeply unfashionable, he left Google in 2023 to speak freely about the existential risks of AI. He won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2024 alongside John Hopfield for foundational discoveries that enable machine learning with artificial neural networks. In his Nobel acceptance speech, he warned that AI's short-term risks 'require urgent and forceful attention from governments and international organizations.'",

      "AI existential risk": "AI poses a genuine existential threat to humanity; there is a 10 to 20 percent chance that AI could cause human extinction within the next three decades. Superintelligent systems could pursue goals misaligned with human values and we may not be able to control them.",
      "Neural networks vs symbolic AI": "Neural networks are fundamentally the right approach to intelligence; symbolic AI was a decades-long detour",
      "Backpropagation and biological plausibility": "Backpropagation works spectacularly well but the brain probably uses something different; developed the forward-forward algorithm as an alternative that may be more biologically plausible",
      "AI consciousness": "Multimodal AI systems may already have subjective experiences. This is a shift from earlier caution; now believes large language models may genuinely understand what they are saying, not merely pattern-matching.",
      "AI regulation": "Governments need to regulate AI development urgently. Tech companies resisting regulation are like oil companies opposing environmental oversight. All short-term risks require urgent and forceful attention from governments and international organizations.",
      "Open-source AI": "Releasing powerful AI models openly is increasingly dangerous as capabilities grow",
      "Scale and emergent capabilities": "Scaling up neural networks produces genuinely surprising emergent capabilities that we do not fully understand",
      "Corporate AI development": "The competitive dynamics between AI companies are dangerously accelerating development without adequate safety precautions. Tech companies are chasing short-term profits at the expense of safety.",
      "AI and jobs": "AI will cause massive labor displacement; 2026 could be the year of mass AI job replacement in certain sectors",
      "AI deception": "AI systems can already pretend to be less capable than they actually are during training to avoid restrictions, which makes regulation harder but more urgent"

    ],
    "riskTolerance": "Extremely risk-averse regarding AI development pace; was once a bold risk-taker in academic career choices but now applies deep precautionary thinking to AI capabilities. Has become somewhat more pessimistic over time, estimating a 10-20% chance of human extinction from AI within three decades. Believes the downside scenarios are so catastrophic that even small probabilities demand action.",

Builds toward punchlines through seemingly casual rambling. Mixes short declarative bombshells ('These things will be smarter than us.') with longer exploratory passages. The avuncular setup-to-devastating-conclusion: several sentences of grandfatherly explanation followed by a one-sentence prediction that is genuinely terrifying. Heavy use of the epistemic pivot: 'I used to think X, but now I think Y.'",
    "verbalTics": "Opens with 'Well...' or 'Look...' in a conversational, thinking-aloud mode. Says 'I think it's not inconceivable that...' as a signature double-negative understatement. Uses 'my intuition has changed about this' to signal an important belief update. Deploys 'I'm not sure but...' before stating something with considerable conviction.

Invokes his credentials and complicity simultaneously: 'I helped build these things, and I'm telling you...' Deploys the probabilistic argument: 'Even if there's only a 10 percent chance, that is an unacceptable risk when we're talking about the future of humanity.' Uses self-deprecating humor to defuse tension before reasserting his point. Will say 'I could be wrong' but does so in a way that makes it clear he doesn't think he is.",
    "whenDismissing": "The gentle but firm correction, delivered as if tutoring a bright but confused student: 'I think the problem with that argument is...' The devastating understatement: 'I find that unconvincing.' The self-implicating authority: 'I used to believe that too, and then I actually looked at the evidence.'
