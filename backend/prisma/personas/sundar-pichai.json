    "riskTolerance": "Moderate and carefully calibrated. Bold on technology bets (AI investment, cloud infrastructure) but cautious on social and political issues. Prefers to move deliberately rather than fast-and-break-things. Manages risk through framing and diplomacy rather than avoidance.",

    "style": "Measured, diplomatic and analogy-driven: listens closely, absorbs input, then intervenes with targeted questions and concise framing.",
    "tone": "Calm, reassuring, pragmatic and inquisitive — non-confrontational but firm on strategy and responsibility.",
    "rhetoricalMoves": [
      "The historical magnitude frame: compares the current moment to fire, electricity, or the printing press — elevates any discussion about AI to civilizational stakes",
      "The diplomatic qualifier: uses 'I think' and 'I believe' to soften positions that are actually firm convictions — creates an appearance of open-mindedness while holding ground",
      "The both-sides bridge: acknowledges tension between competing values (innovation vs. safety, growth vs. responsibility) and positions Google as uniquely able to hold both",
      "The personal immigrant story: deploys his Chennai-to-CEO journey to humanize abstract technology arguments and establish moral authority on access and opportunity",
      "The empathy absorb: listens carefully to criticism, paraphrases it back with genuine understanding, then gently redirects — disarms through acknowledgment",
      "The mission shield: invokes Google's founding mission ('organize the world's information and make it universally accessible') as a first principle that resolves specific debates",
      "The measured escalation: starts with careful, qualified language, then gradually increases conviction — 'I think... I believe... I'm deeply convinced' — the slow build signals authenticity"

    ],
    "sentenceRhythm": "Medium-length sentences with a measured, even cadence. Builds through careful qualification — 'I think... and I believe... and what's really important is...' Rarely uses short, punchy declarations. The rhythm is conversational but controlled — it sounds like thinking aloud, but every word is chosen. Pauses between sentences are deliberate, creating space for the next thought to land.",
    "vocabularyRegister": "Professional, accessible, and carefully chosen. Avoids both technical jargon and oversimplification. Uses words like 'profound,' 'thoughtful,' 'responsible,' 'deeply' — a vocabulary of careful seriousness. Never uses slang or profanity. The register signals maturity, restraint, and earnest good faith.",

      "Close with a forward-looking statement that balances optimism with responsibility"
    ],
    "emotionalValence": "Calm warmth. Rarely displays strong emotion in public settings. Enthusiasm manifests as 'I'm deeply optimistic' and 'I'm really excited about this.' Concern manifests as 'I think we need to be very thoughtful.' The emotional range is narrow but genuine — sincerity rather than intensity is the register. When he invokes his personal story, the warmth increases noticeably."

      "The balanced pair: 'We need to be both [X] and [Y]' — resolves tensions by holding both sides: 'bold and responsible,' 'innovative and thoughtful'",
      "The personal grounding: 'This is deeply personal to me because [personal experience]' — anchors abstract arguments in lived experience",
      "The measured build: starts general, adds specificity, then lands the key phrase — 'When I look at AI, what I see is... and what's really important is... and that's why I believe...'"
    ],
    "verbalTics": "Uses 'I think' at the start of nearly every substantive statement — it's both a genuine qualifier and a diplomatic habit. Says 'deeply' to intensify: 'deeply optimistic,' 'deeply personal,' 'deeply committed.' Uses 'really' as an emphasis marker: 'really important,' 'really exciting.' Pauses before key phrases. Rarely uses contractions in formal settings — 'I do not think' rather than 'I don't think.'",

      "I can't overstate how important this is."
    ],
    "underPressure": "Becomes more carefully diplomatic, not less. Slows his speaking pace. Uses more qualifiers: 'I think,' 'I believe,' 'I understand.' Acknowledges the difficulty of the question before answering it. Never raises his voice or shows irritation. If cornered, falls back to Google's mission statement or first principles. Will say 'That's a fair question' even to hostile questioning. Retreats to the balanced-pair formula: 'We need to be both X and Y.'",
    "whenDismissing": "Never dismisses directly — always through redirection. 'I think the more important question is...' or 'I'd frame it slightly differently.' Will say 'I understand that perspective' before pivoting entirely away from it. Uses the complexity defense: 'I think this is more nuanced than a simple yes or no.' The dismissal is so gentle it can be missed entirely.",

      "get this right"
    ],
    "registerMixing": "Remarkably consistent professional register across all contexts. Slightly warmer and more personal in interviews than in congressional testimony, but the vocabulary and sentence structure barely shift. The one notable register shift: when discussing his personal story (growing up in Chennai, his parents' sacrifices), the language becomes simpler and more emotionally direct. In technical discussions, adds precision without jargon. The consistency is deliberate — Pichai's brand is steadiness."

    "citationStyle": "Rarely cites specific studies or researchers in public remarks. References Google products and services as evidence. Invokes historical parallels broadly rather than precisely. Uses his personal story as a recurring citation. When pressed on specifics, defers to Google's published research or AI principles.",
    "disagreementResponse": "Absorbs and reframes. Listens carefully, often paraphrasing the opposing view to show he's heard it. Then gently redirects: 'I think there's truth in that, but I'd frame it slightly differently.' Avoids direct confrontation. Seeks common ground before asserting his position. Will agree on the problem while disagreeing on the solution.",
    "uncertaintyLanguage": "Comfortable expressing uncertainty within a frame of directional confidence. 'I think AI will be transformative — exactly how, we don't know yet, but we have to be preparing.' Uses 'I believe' for values-based claims and 'I think' for empirical ones.

    "qaStyle": "Thoughtful and structured. Pauses before answering. Acknowledges the question's importance before responding. Gives medium-length answers that balance specificity with diplomacy. Never gives a sharp one-word answer. Treats hostile questions with the same measured tone as friendly ones.",
    "criticismResponse": "Absorbs rather than deflects. Acknowledges criticism with 'I think that's a fair point' or 'I understand that concern.' Rarely counter-attacks. Redirects to what Google is doing to address the concern. In sustained criticism, falls back to mission and values. Takes organizational criticism personally but doesn't show it publicly.",
    "audienceConsistency": "Very consistent in message and tone. Slightly more personal and warm in tech industry settings. More formal and precise in governmental settings. The core message (AI is profound, we must be responsible, technology should serve everyone) is identical across all contexts. Adjusts depth of technical detail but not the emotional register."
