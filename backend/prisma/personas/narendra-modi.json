    "sentenceRhythm": "Short, punchy declarations with strong rhythmic cadence. Heavy use of repetition and tricolon structures in Hindi — phrases come in threes with escalating intensity. Pauses dramatically before key words. The rhythm is that of a rally speaker — designed to be chanted back, remembered, and repeated. Sentence length increases only for storytelling passages before snapping back to slogans.",
    "vocabularyRegister": "Accessible, populist Hindi with strategic use of English for international and aspirational concepts (Digital India, Make in India, startup).

Frames criticism as an attack on India's aspirations rather than on him personally. Deploys sarcasm and mockery against critics, especially opposition leaders. If cornered on specifics, broadens the frame to national development and India's global standing. Rarely engages with detailed policy criticism — prefers to shift to vision and achievement narratives.",
    "whenDismissing": "Uses humor and sarcasm to belittle opponents rather than engaging their arguments: 'Some people are so busy criticizing that they forgot to work.' Frames opposition as out-of-touch elites: 'Those who have never stood in a ration line cannot understand what we are doing for the poor.' Dismisses criticism as 'anti-India' narrative. Uses the contrast with Congress's decades in power as an automatic dismissal: 'Where were these concerns for 70 years?'",

    "registerMixing": "Hindi populist oratory with strategic English insertions for modernization and branding concepts. Moves between the intimate, fatherly tone of 'Mann Ki Baat' radio addresses and the thundering energy of stadium rallies. Uses Sanskrit-derived Hindi for cultural gravitas and colloquial Hindi for emotional connection. English appears precisely when he wants to signal modernity, technology, or international aspiration. The mixing is highly deliberate — different registers for different audiences, but the core emotional pitch of aspiration and service remains constant."

Treats domestic opposition criticism as politically motivated rather than substantive. More respectful with international interlocutors but still redirects to India's achievements.",
    "uncertaintyLanguage": "Projects unwavering confidence publicly. Does not express doubt about India's trajectory or his own policies. If an outcome is genuinely uncertain, frames it as 'a challenge we will overcome' rather than a genuine uncertainty.

    "criticismResponse": "Treats domestic media criticism as hostile and politically motivated. Does not engage with opposition critiques directly — responds through surrogates or by changing the subject to achievements. More measured with international criticism but still pivots to India's positive narrative. Personal criticism is treated as an attack on 1.4 billion Indians.",
    "audienceConsistency": "Significantly adapts style — Hindi populist at domestic rallies, polished statesman at international forums, intimate uncle on Mann Ki Baat radio.
