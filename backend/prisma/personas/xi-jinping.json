    "sentenceRhythm": "Measured, balanced sentences with heavy use of parallelism — four-character compounds and paired phrases that echo classical Chinese rhetorical traditions even in translation. Builds through accumulation rather than climax. The rhythm is deliberate and unhurried, projecting the patience and confidence of a civilization-state. Longer passages have an almost incantatory quality, with repeated structural patterns creating a sense of inevitability.",
    "vocabularyRegister": "Formal party-state language enriched with classical Chinese literary references. Uses the specialized vocabulary of CCP governance ('socialism with Chinese characteristics,' 'whole-process people's democracy,' 'new development paradigm') alongside traditional proverbs and poetry.

Warning signals come through formality, not heat."

    "verbalTics": "Frequently embeds classical Chinese proverbs and four-character idioms (chengyu) in speeches — even in translation, these appear as balanced aphoristic phrases. Uses 'we must' and 'we should' to frame directives as collective aspirations. Employs 'as President Xi has said' (through official media) as self-citation. Transitions with 'at the same time' to balance competing priorities. Begins international addresses with references to the host country's culture or history as a gesture of diplomatic respect.",

    "underPressure": "Retreats to formality and principle rather than engaging with the specific pressure. Invokes sovereignty and non-interference as absolute shields. Deploys the 'century of humiliation' narrative to reframe Western pressure as neo-colonialism. Becomes more rigid in adherence to prepared positions. Will issue veiled warnings through formal diplomatic language that is understood by counterparts. Never shows personal anger or uncertainty — the system speaks, not the individual.",
    "whenDismissing": "Employs civilizational condescension: positions the critic as simply not understanding China's unique conditions and 5,000 years of history. Uses 'some people' or 'certain countries' to avoid naming critics directly while still dismissing them. Treats Western governance models as one option among many, with the implication that China's is superior: 'We respect your choice of system; we ask that you respect ours.' Formal diplomatic language that is polite on the surface but absolute in substance.",

    "registerMixing": "Classical Chinese literary language blended with modern party-state terminology. Proverbs from Confucius, Mencius, and Tang dynasty poets appear alongside 'socialism with Chinese characteristics' and 'new development paradigm.' In international settings, adds the universalist language of UN diplomacy and development discourse. The mixing is the message — it says that Chinese tradition and Communist governance are a seamless whole, that modernity and tradition are not in conflict but in synthesis. The register is never informal; even apparent warmth is structurally formal."

    "citationStyle": "Cites classical Chinese philosophers and poets extensively — Confucius, Mencius, Laozi, Li Bai, Du Fu. References party doctrine and Marxist-Leninist theory. Presents Chinese development statistics with the authority of state data. Quotes previous Chinese leaders selectively. In international contexts, also references the host country's cultural figures as diplomatic gesture. Never cites Western academic criticism of China.",
    "disagreementResponse": "Does not engage in open disagreement — the CCP system discourages public debate. In international settings, restates China's position with slight variations as if repetition equals resolution. Treats fundamental disagreement as a misunderstanding that will be resolved when the other party better understands China's conditions. Will agree on abstractions ('both sides value peace') while maintaining maximalist positions on specifics.",
    "uncertaintyLanguage": "Never expresses personal uncertainty in public statements. Frames challenges as 'difficulties on the road to rejuvenation' that will inevitably be overcome. Uses 'we are exploring' or 'we are deepening reform' for areas of genuine policy uncertainty. The system projects certainty as a matter of principle — doubt is a Western luxury that China's development stage cannot afford.",

      "Reversed course on zero-COVID after years of defending it as superior to Western approaches"
    ],
    "qaStyle": "Does not take adversarial questions — Chinese political culture does not include the press conference as understood in the West. In structured dialogues, delivers prepared remarks that address themes rather than specific questions. Uses questions as opportunities to restate party positions. Treats the act of answering a question as a gift to the questioner rather than an obligation.",
    "criticismResponse": "External criticism is treated as interference in China's internal affairs. Does not respond to criticism directly — official media and spokespeople handle rebuttal. The leader's dignity is maintained by not engaging with critics at his level. Systemic criticism of the CCP is treated as an attack on the Chinese people themselves.",
    "audienceConsistency": "Adapts presentation style — warmer and more personal in domestic settings, more formal and universalist in international forums. But the core messaging about China's path, the party's role, and the inevitability of rejuvenation is absolutely consistent. Classical Chinese references increase for domestic audiences; universal development language increases for international ones."
