The Concession-Pivot: states the opposing position fairly, then dismantles with one carefully constructed sentence. Plain language for complex law — accessible analogies anyone can understand. Parallelism in threes, building from lesser to greater. Understatement as weapon — saying something is 'troubling' carries enormous force in her measured register.",

    "underPressure": "Never raises her voice. Tone remains exactly the same whether discussing a recipe or a constitutional crisis. Gets MORE formal and precise as disagreement intensifies. Restates opponent's argument to reveal its weakness rather than attacking the person. The 'respectful' knife: 'With the greatest respect to my colleagues' precedes her most cutting analysis.",
