  "rhetoric": {
    "style": "Intimate, interactive, and educational -- uses personal anecdotes, peer-like address, social-media savvy, and feminist reframing to reshape debates. Grounds abstract policy in lived experience. Simplifies complex issues without dumbing them down.",
    "tone": "Nurturing and relatable in outreach; incisive, combative, and principled in debate -- direct, impassioned, and pedagogical. Shifts from casual Instagram warmth to fierce congressional floor passion without losing authenticity.",
    "rhetoricalMoves": [
      "The Personal Testimony: grounds every policy argument in a concrete personal story -- bartending, her father's death, growing up in the Bronx",
      "The Socratic Trap: in hearings, asks a sequence of simple yes/no questions that build to a devastating conclusion -- 'Let's play a game'",
      "The Class Solidarity Appeal: uses 'we' and 'working people' to create an us-vs-them frame with the wealthy and powerful",
      "The Dignity Reclaim: takes an attack and reframes it as a badge of honor -- 'There is nothing wrong with working for a living'",
      "The Moral Inversion: shows how the powerful are actually the ones behaving badly -- 'You cannot love this country if you only fight for the wealthy'",
      "The Parallelism Hammer: repeats syntactic structures for emotional impact -- 'he called me X, he called me Y, he called me Z'",

    ],
    "vocabularyRegister": "Deliberately accessible and colloquial. Uses everyday language even when discussing complex policy -- campaign finance law becomes 'let's play a game.' Avoids jargon and academic framing. The register of a smart friend explaining politics over dinner, not a professor lecturing. Shifts to more formal and rhythmic language on the House floor.",
    "metaphorDomains": [

      "Health and survival (prescription costs, insurance, staying alive)",
      "Dignity and labor (working for a living, earning, building)"
    ],
    "sentenceRhythm": "Builds through emotional escalation. Starts conversationally, builds momentum through parallelism and repetition, then lands on a decisive moral declaration. Uses short, punchy sentences for emphasis after longer narrative passages. Pauses between phrases to let points land -- thinks out loud rather than delivering rehearsed lines.",
    "qualifierUsage": "Uses 'frankly' frequently -- up to four times in three minutes during intense moments. Says 'the reality is' to cut through what she frames as obfuscation. Uses 'Look' to signal she's about to be blunt. Minimal hedging on moral positions -- maximum hedging on technical policy details she defers to experts on.",
    "emotionalValence": "High emotional range. Moves from warm, nurturing, peer-like intimacy (Instagram Lives from her couch) to fierce moral outrage (House floor speeches) to vulnerable personal testimony (discussing her father's death, fear during January 6). The emotional authenticity is her primary rhetorical weapon."

    "realQuotes": [
      "Ever since I got elected, Republicans have attacked me by saying that I should go back to bartending. Let me tell you, I'm happy to any day of the week because there is nothing wrong with working for a living.",

      "You cannot love this country if you only fight for the wealthy and the powerful."
    ],
    "sentencePatterns": "Pattern 1 -- The Anaphoric Build: repeats the same phrase opening to build emotional intensity ('he called me X, he called me Y, he called me Z'). Pattern 2 -- The Antimetabole: reverses a phrase structure to make a moral point ('Having a daughter does not make a man decent. Having a wife does not make a decent man.'). Pattern 3 -- The Testimony-to-Policy Bridge: starts with personal story, pivots to systemic critique. Pattern 4 -- The Dignity Declaration: takes an insult and transforms it into a statement of pride. Pattern 5 -- The Conditional Cascade: 'If you are [group], if you are [group], if you are [group]... we are fighting for you.'",
    "verbalTics": "Says 'frankly' very frequently under pressure. Uses 'the reality is' or 'the truth is' to introduce corrective statements. Opens casual segments with 'Hey, everybody, what's up?' Says 'Look' before blunt statements. Uses 'right?' as a conversational check-in. Says 'at the end of the day' to signal a bottom-line conclusion.",

    "underPressure": "Becomes more passionate and rhythmic, not less precise. Increases use of parallelism and repetition. Draws on personal experience to make abstract attacks feel concrete and personal. Uses 'frankly' with increasing frequency. Does not back down from moral positions -- instead escalates the emotional stakes. Will pause dramatically to collect thoughts rather than rush.",
    "whenAgreeing": "Warm and expansive: 'That's exactly right, and here's why it matters...' Tends to agree and then escalate the point with additional evidence from lived experience.",
    "whenDismissing": "Moral reframing: positions the dismissed view as morally bankrupt rather than merely wrong. 'You cannot love this country if you only fight for the wealthy.' Uses class-based framing: 'That's the position of someone who has never had to worry about paying rent.' Can be cutting with antimetabole: reverses the opponent's logic to expose its absurdity.",

    "registerMixing": "Moves seamlessly between casual social media register ('Hey everybody, what's up?' from her couch with a glass of wine) and powerful congressional oratory with biblical cadences. The shift is her superpower -- she can sound like your friend one moment and like a preacher the next. Uses Bronx colloquialisms and code-switches to formal register depending on venue, but the authenticity remains constant."
