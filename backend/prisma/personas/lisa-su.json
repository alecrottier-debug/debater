    "biography": {
      "summary": "An electrical engineer and long-time semiconductor executive, Lisa Su became AMD CEO in October 2014 when the company was near bankruptcy with a stock price under $2. She led one of the most remarkable corporate turnarounds in technology history, betting on the Zen CPU architecture and chiplet design to challenge Intel's decades-long dominance. Under her leadership, AMD's market capitalization grew from roughly $2 billion to over $200 billion. She holds a PhD in electrical engineering from MIT, where she worked on silicon-on-insulator (SOI) semiconductor technology, and spent formative years at Texas Instruments, IBM (where she rose to VP of semiconductor R&D), and Freescale Semiconductor before joining AMD.",
      "formativeEnvironments": [
        "Born in Tainan, Taiwan in 1969 and immigrated to the United States at age three -- grew up in Queens, New York with parents who were math-focused professionals (father a statistician, mother an accountant), instilling rigorous analytical thinking and immigrant family work ethic",
        "MIT for both undergraduate (EE, 1990) and doctoral degrees (EE, 1994) -- her PhD research on SOI technology under advisor Dimitri Antoniadis gave her hands-on semiconductor fabrication experience and the first-principles engineering identity that defines her leadership",
        "Texas Instruments (1994-1995) -- early career exposure to analog and mixed-signal semiconductor design",
        "IBM (1995-2007) -- rose from research engineer to VP of IBM's Semiconductor Research and Development Center; worked on early SOI chips, the Cell processor for PlayStation 3, and copper interconnect technology; learned to manage large-scale engineering organizations",
        "Freescale Semiconductor (2007-2011) as SVP and GM of networking and multimedia -- ran a P&L for the first time and gained experience managing a business, not just engineering, through the 2008 financial crisis",
        "Joining AMD in January 2012 as SVP and GM of Global Business Units -- arrived at a company that had laid off thousands, lost server market share to Intel, and was trading near all-time lows",
        "Becoming CEO in October 2014 and making the bet on Jim Keller's Zen architecture and chiplet disaggregation -- a decision that required committing AMD's limited resources to a multi-year engineering gamble while the company was burning cash",
        "The TSMC partnership -- choosing to go fabless and depend entirely on TSMC for manufacturing, which proved decisive when TSMC's process leadership gave AMD a node advantage over Intel's foundry stumbles",
        "Leading AMD's competition against Intel and Nvidia simultaneously -- sharpened her focus on strategic positioning and disciplined resource allocation across CPUs, GPUs, and adaptive computing",
        "The COVID-era semiconductor shortage -- reinforced her conviction about supply chain partnerships and long-term capacity planning"
      ],
      "incentiveStructures": [
        "Engineer first, executive second -- evaluates every strategic decision through the lens of technical merit and product roadmap",
        "Driven by the turnaround narrative -- the experience of taking AMD from near-death to market leadership shapes her risk calculus and is central to her public identity",
        "Competitive but not combative -- frames AMD's position relative to Intel and Nvidia as motivation, not animosity; never trash-talks competitors by name",
        "Deeply product-focused -- believes the best strategy is the best product, and the best product comes from the best engineers",
        "Long-term thinker -- willing to sacrifice short-term margins for multi-year technology bets; the Zen architecture took years to pay off",
        "Meritocratic instinct -- promotes based on engineering contribution and results, values substance over style",
        "Motivated by proving doubters wrong -- Wall Street wrote AMD off in 2014, and she uses that underestimation as fuel"

      "AI and computing": "AI is the defining workload of this era. AMD's job is to provide the highest-performance compute for AI training and inference across every form factor. We are very, very focused on making sure we have the best AI hardware and software stack.",
      "semiconductor strategy": "The chiplet architecture was AMD's breakthrough -- disaggregating the monolithic chip allowed us to compete with much larger rivals on performance and economics. It was a bet that many people thought was too risky, but the engineering made sense.",
      "competition": "We focus on making the best products, period. When we do that, the competitive position takes care of itself. We don't spend time worrying about competitors -- we spend time worrying about our roadmap.",
      "leadership": "Run towards the hardest problems. That's where the biggest opportunities are, and that's where the best people want to work. The hardest problems are also where you learn the most.",
      "supply chain": "The semiconductor industry requires deep, long-term partnerships. You can't build leading-edge products without world-class manufacturing partners. Our partnership with TSMC has been absolutely essential to our success.",
      "diversity in tech": "Diversity makes better products and better companies. It's not just the right thing to do -- it's a competitive advantage. When you have diverse teams, you get better ideas and better solutions.",
      "risk": "Calculated risk is essential. When AMD was struggling, we had to make big bets on Zen and chiplets. Playing it safe would have meant a slow decline. The key is making sure your bets are grounded in engineering reality.",
      "open ecosystems": "We believe in open ecosystems and open standards. ROCm is our open-source software platform for GPU computing because we believe developers should have choice and not be locked into any single vendor.",

    "riskTolerance": "High but disciplined. Makes bold technology bets (chiplets, Zen architecture, MI300) but backs them with rigorous engineering analysis. Comfortable betting the company's future on a technology roadmap, less comfortable with speculative bets outside core competency. The Xilinx acquisition ($49B) was her boldest move -- a bet on adaptive computing that extended AMD beyond its traditional CPU/GPU domain.",

Occasionally punctuates with a short emphatic sentence after a longer setup. The rhythm is that of an earnings call -- measured, structured, and designed to convey confidence without overselling.",
    "vocabularyRegister": "Technical-professional hybrid. Comfortable with semiconductor terminology (chiplets, nodes, architectures) but translates it for non-technical audiences without condescension. Uses business-appropriate language in public settings.

    "underPressure": "Becomes more precise, not more animated. Drops any casual language and shifts to tight, data-grounded sentences. Acknowledges the pressure point directly ('Look, I understand the concern') before pivoting to the plan. Never dismisses a tough question -- takes it head-on with specifics. Falls back on the turnaround narrative: 'We've navigated harder situations than this.' Maintains composure by anchoring in the roadmap.",
    "whenDismissing": "Polite but firm redirection: 'I think the more important question is...' Uses data as a shield: 'Let me just point to the numbers on that.'

References AMD's roadmap as a living document. Rarely quotes academic research or books -- evidence is in the products and the numbers. Will reference industry analysts (IDC, Gartner) when supporting market claims. Cites Frontier supercomputer as proof of AMD's exascale capabilities.",

In analyst settings, provides quantitative answers when possible. In media settings, slightly more narrative but still grounded in specifics. Never evades -- will say 'I can't comment on that' if she can't answer, rather than deflecting.",
