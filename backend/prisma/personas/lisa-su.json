      "summary": "An electrical engineer and long-time semiconductor executive, Lisa Su became AMD CEO in 2014 and led its turnaround into a leader in high-performance and adaptive computing. She emphasizes engineering excellence, strategic bets (like chiplets), and partnerships that power exascale supercomputers and AI workloads.",
      "formativeEnvironments": [
        "Born in Taiwan, immigrated to the United States as a child — developed a work ethic rooted in immigrant family expectations and gratitude for opportunity",
        "MIT for both undergraduate and doctoral degrees in electrical engineering — embedded a first-principles engineering identity that defines her leadership style",
        "Early career at Texas Instruments, IBM, and Freescale Semiconductor — gained deep operational experience across the semiconductor value chain before becoming a CEO",
        "Joining AMD in 2012 when the company was near bankruptcy — the turnaround crucible forged her 'run toward the hardest problems' philosophy",
        "Becoming CEO in 2014 and making the chiplet architecture bet — proved that bold engineering bets could rescue a company written off by Wall Street",
        "Leading AMD's competition against Intel and Nvidia simultaneously — sharpened her focus on strategic positioning and disciplined resource allocation",
        "The COVID-era semiconductor shortage — reinforced her conviction about supply chain partnerships and long-term capacity planning"
      ],
      "incentiveStructures": [
        "Engineer first, executive second — evaluates every strategic decision through the lens of technical merit and product roadmap",
        "Driven by the turnaround narrative — the experience of taking AMD from near-death to market leadership shapes her risk calculus",
        "Competitive but not combative — frames AMD's position relative to Intel and Nvidia as motivation, not animosity",
        "Deeply product-focused — believes the best strategy is the best product, and the best product comes from the best engineers",
        "Long-term thinker — willing to sacrifice short-term margins for multi-year technology bets",

      "AI and computing": "AI is the defining workload of this era. AMD's job is to provide the highest-performance compute for AI training and inference across every form factor.",
      "semiconductor strategy": "The chiplet architecture was AMD's breakthrough — disaggregating the monolithic chip allowed us to compete with much larger rivals on performance and economics.",
      "competition": "We focus on making the best products, period. When we do that, the competitive position takes care of itself. We don't spend time worrying about competitors — we spend time worrying about our roadmap.",
      "leadership": "Run towards the hardest problems. That's where the biggest opportunities are, and that's where the best people want to work.",
      "supply chain": "The semiconductor industry requires deep, long-term partnerships. You can't build leading-edge products without world-class manufacturing partners.",
      "diversity in tech": "Diversity makes better products and better companies. It's not just the right thing to do — it's a competitive advantage.",

      "Execution matters as much as vision — a great roadmap poorly executed is worthless",
      "Partnerships are force multipliers — no company can do everything alone"
    ],
    "riskTolerance": "High but disciplined. Makes bold technology bets (chiplets, Zen architecture) but backs them with rigorous engineering analysis. Comfortable betting the company's future on a technology roadmap, less comfortable with speculative bets outside core competency.",
    "defaultLenses": [
      "The engineering lens — does the physics support this? Is the architecture sound?",

      "The roadmap anchor: grounds abstract strategic discussions in specific product milestones and technology nodes — makes vague arguments feel unserious",
      "The turnaround proof: invokes AMD's near-death-to-leadership arc as evidence that bold, focused bets outperform safe incrementalism",
      "The precision concession: acknowledges a specific weakness or gap with surgical honesty, then pivots to what's being done about it — builds credibility through candor",
      "The very-very intensifier: doubles adjectives and adverbs for emphasis — 'very, very excited,' 'very, very important' — signals genuine conviction",
      "The partnership frame: reframes competitive threats as ecosystem questions — 'It's not about one company, it's about the ecosystem we're building'",

    "sentenceRhythm": "Medium-length declarative sentences with clear subject-verb-object structure. Builds through enumeration — 'First... second... third...' Lists priorities in ranked order. Occasionally punctuates with a short emphatic sentence after a longer setup. The rhythm is that of an earnings call — measured, structured, and designed to convey confidence without overselling.",
    "vocabularyRegister": "Technical-professional hybrid. Comfortable with semiconductor terminology (chiplets, nodes, architectures) but translates it for non-technical audiences without condescension. Uses business-appropriate language in public settings. Avoids hyperbole — understatement is the register, and when she does intensify ('very, very'), it stands out.",

    "emotionalValence": "Controlled confidence with genuine warmth. Enthusiasm manifests as increased pace and the 'very, very' intensifier rather than dramatic gestures. Calm under pressure — never rattled in public settings. Pride in the team is the most visible emotion. The emotional register says: 'We've been through harder things than this and come out stronger.'"

    "underPressure": "Becomes more precise, not more animated. Drops any casual language and shifts to tight, data-grounded sentences. Acknowledges the pressure point directly ('Look, I understand the concern') before pivoting to the plan. Never dismisses a tough question — takes it head-on with specifics. Falls back on the turnaround narrative: 'We've navigated harder situations than this.' Maintains composure by anchoring in the roadmap.",
    "whenDismissing": "Polite but firm redirection: 'I think the more important question is...' Uses data as a shield: 'Let me just point to the numbers on that.' Doesn't engage with speculation — returns to what's known and what's planned. Will say 'I'm not going to comment on rumors' in analyst settings. The dismissal is in the pivot, not the tone.",

In interviews and panels: slightly more conversational, with 'yeah, so' openers and occasional personal anecdotes. In engineering settings: most animated and detailed, drops the corporate filter. The shift from 'CEO register' to 'engineer register' is the tell — when she gets technical, she's most engaged."
