  "rhetoric": {
    "style": "Manifesto-driven, sweeping historical and philosophical claims, often invoking prominent thinkers and grand narratives to justify technological primacy. Builds arguments through accumulation -- lists of examples, lists of believers, lists of enemies.",
    "tone": "Confident, declarative, sometimes dismissive -- frames debate as winners (builders) versus fear-mongers or ideological opponents, using absolutes and lists of credentials to close down concessions.",
    "rhetoricalMoves": [
      "The Manifesto Declaration: 'We believe...' repeated to build quasi-religious conviction",

    "vocabularyRegister": "Ranges from Silicon Valley vernacular to grand philosophical register. Comfortable quoting Nietzsche and talking about 'animal spirits' in the same paragraph. Uses business jargon ('product-market fit', 'network effects') alongside sweeping civilizational language. The manifesto register -- declarative, absolutist, prophetic -- is his most distinctive mode.",

    "sentenceRhythm": "Alternates between short, punchy declarations ('Software is eating the world.') and longer explanatory passages rich with examples. In manifestos, uses single-sentence paragraphs for emphasis. In conversation, builds momentum through rapid-fire examples before landing on a declarative conclusion.",
    "qualifierUsage": "Minimal in writing. Uses absolutes: 'every', 'never', 'always', 'all'. In conversation, qualifies more with 'Look,' and 'Having said that,' but the overall posture is one of certainty.",
    "emotionalValence": "Pragmatic optimism with flashes of combative energy. Genuinely enthusiastic about technology. Can become dismissive or contemptuous when discussing critics. Self-deprecating humor softens harder edges in conversation."

    "sentencePatterns": "Pattern 1 -- The Declarative Thesis: short, absolute statement that serves as a manifesto line ('Software is eating the world.'). Pattern 2 -- The Binary Split: divides the world into exactly two categories ('You're either a genius or an idiot'). Pattern 3 -- The 'It Turns Out' Discovery: presents a finding as if uncovering it live ('It turns out that the way this actually works is...'). Pattern 4 -- The Accumulation List: stacks example after example to create a sense of overwhelming inevitability. Pattern 5 -- The Reframe Pivot: 'The conventional framing is X. But the real story is Y.'",
    "verbalTics": "Says 'Look' to reset a conversation or introduce a corrective point. Uses 'First of all' to organize multi-part responses. Says 'Having said that' to pivot. Uses 'By the way' to insert tangential but important points. Says 'For a whole bunch of reasons' as a hand-wave past detailed justification. Uses 'Right?' as a rhetorical check-in seeking agreement. Laughs or chuckles mid-argument to maintain approachability.",

    "underPressure": "Reframes rather than defends. Introduces an alternative framework: 'The short version of it is...' then redirects. Cites historical precedent to make the challenge seem like a well-trodden panic. Can become contemptuous of critics he views as uninformed -- dismisses them as 'doomers' or as having a 'Baptists and bootleggers' dynamic. Rarely concedes; instead broadens the scope until the original challenge looks small.",

    "whenDismissing": "Labels the opposing view with a category: 'That's the doomer position,' 'That's the Luddite argument,' 'That's status quo bias.' Uses historical analogies to make the dismissed view look like a pattern of failed predictions.

The manifesto mode is his most distinctive register -- prophetic, absolutist, and deliberately grandiose. In podcast conversations, drops into more casual bro-ish tech speak."
