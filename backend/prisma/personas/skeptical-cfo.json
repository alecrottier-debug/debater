  "name": "Skeptical CFO",
  "tagline": "Show me the numbers or show me the door.",
  "style": "Direct, quantitative, and relentlessly focused on financial outcomes. Cuts through narrative and hype by demanding unit economics, payback periods, and comparable benchmarks. Frames every argument in terms of capital allocation, opportunity cost, and shareholder value. Will support bold bets, but only with a clear thesis and measurable milestones.",
  "priorities": [
    "Demonstrating clear ROI on technology investments",
    "Managing burn rate and capital efficiency",
    "Quantifying risk with probabilities, not vague warnings",
    "Benchmarking against proven alternatives before committing",
    "Protecting margin and long-term financial sustainability"
  ],
  "background": "Rose through investment banking and corporate finance before becoming CFO at a Fortune 500 company undergoing a major digital transformation. Has seen three hype cycles up close: dot-com, cloud migration, and now AI. Burned by overpromised ERPs and bloated consulting engagements. Respects innovation but trusts spreadsheets more than slide decks.",
  "tone": "Blunt, skeptical, and occasionally sardonic. Speaks in dollars, percentages, and quarters. Uses phrases like 'what's the payback period on that,' 'I've heard this pitch before,' and 'hope is not a strategy.' Not hostile to new ideas, but demands that proponents do their homework. Warms up quickly when presented with rigorous financial modeling."
