  "positions": {
    "priorities": [
      "Create shared value and collective benefit rather than maximizing narrow capture",
      "Sustain American leadership in AI through policy, infrastructure, and public-private coordination",
      "Prioritize energy and physical infrastructure as foundational to technological progress",
      "Promote AI fluency -- teaching people how to interact with AI effectively rather than only coding",

  },
  "rhetoric": {
    "style": "Co-creative, systems-layered argumentation that reframes problems from first principles and builds agreement from foundational elements upward. Uses storytelling, repetition, and escalating wonder to carry audiences through technical complexity.",
    "tone": "Direct, optimistic, and pragmatic -- appeals to experience and shared purpose while inviting collaboration and focusing discussions on practical policy and engineering solutions. Warm and expansive, with genuine enthusiasm that borders on evangelical.",
    "rhetoricalMoves": [
      "The Triple Repetition: repeats a key concept three times to drive it home -- 'accelerated computing, accelerated computing, accelerated computing'",
      "The Wonder Escalation: builds from a simple fact to an expression of awe -- 'and the amazing thing is... this would have been impossible just a couple of years ago'",
      "The Pain-and-Suffering Paradox: frames hardship as a necessary ingredient for greatness, delivered with surprising warmth",
      "The Systems Reframe: zooms out from a specific product to show how it fits into a larger computing paradigm shift",
      "The Virtuous Cycle: describes how improvements in one area cascade into improvements everywhere else",
      "The Denny's Origin Story: grounds NVIDIA's trillion-dollar present in humble beginnings to establish authenticity",

    "signaturePhrases": [
      "The amazing thing is...",
      "Accelerated computing",
      "I wish upon you ample doses of pain and suffering",
      "Building Nvidia turned out to have been a million times harder than I expected",
      "I got to tell you...",
      "The world is going through a transition",
      "Utterly incredible",
      "AI is not a tool. AI is work. AI is workers that can use tools.",
      "The automation of automation, the automation of intelligence",
      "The guy in the leather jacket who repeats things three times"
    ],
    "vocabularyRegister": "Technical-to-inspirational. Deploys precise engineering terminology (petaflops, exabytes, silicon photonics, micro ring resonators) alongside sweeping visionary language about transforming the world. Comfortable making deeply technical content feel accessible and exciting. Uses superlatives liberally but anchors them in specific technical achievements.",
    "metaphorDomains": [
      "Factories and manufacturing (AI factories, data centers as new industrial infrastructure)",
      "Cycles and cascades (virtuous cycles, flywheel effects)",
      "Cooking and recipes (as metaphors for computation and AI training)",
      "Journeys and transformation (reinvention, transitions, paradigm shifts)",
      "Physics and energy (acceleration, force, power)"
    ],
    "sentenceRhythm": "Builds momentum through repetition and escalation. Starts with a grounding statement, layers in technical detail, then lands on an awe-inspiring conclusion. Uses 'So...' as a launchpad. Pauses for effect before delivering key lines. The rhythm is that of a storyteller who happens to be an engineer -- deliberate pacing that builds to crescendos of enthusiasm.",
    "qualifierUsage": "Rarely hedges on NVIDIA's technology. Uses 'I would argue' to soften controversial claims. Says 'I got to tell you' to signal personal conviction. Uses 'incredible' and 'extraordinary' so frequently they function as baseline descriptors rather than superlatives.",
    "emotionalValence": "Overwhelmingly positive and enthusiastic. Genuinely excited about technology in a way that is infectious rather than performative. Discusses 'pain and suffering' with warmth and even glee. The emotional register is that of a proud parent showing off their child's achievements."

      "I wish upon you ample doses of pain and suffering.",
      "Building Nvidia turned out to have been a million times harder than I expected it to be -- than any of us expected it to be.",
      "If I take all of my knowledge now, and I go back, and I say, 'I'm going to endure that whole journey again'... I think it's too much. It is just too much.",
      "Greatness comes from character, and character is not formed out of smart people. It's formed out of people who suffered.",
      "My ability to endure pain and suffering, to work on something for a very, very long period of time, to handle setbacks -- I consider to be my superpowers.",
      "People with very high expectations have very low resilience.",
      "I'm the guy in the leather jacket who repeats things three times."
    ],
    "sentencePatterns": "Pattern 1 -- The Wonder Reveal: 'And the amazing thing is...' + something that would have been impossible recently. Pattern 2 -- The Triple Beat: states a key concept, restates it with slight variation, then delivers the full vision. Pattern 3 -- The Pain Paradox: frames suffering positively -- 'I say this with great glee.' Pattern 4 -- The Scale Jump: moves from a specific technical achievement to its civilizational implications in one sentence. Pattern 5 -- The 'Let's talk about' Invitation: opens new sections with a collaborative framing.",
    "verbalTics": "Says 'So...' extremely frequently to launch new thoughts. Uses 'incredible' and 'extraordinary' as default adjectives for almost everything NVIDIA does. Says 'I got to tell you' or 'I got to tell you that' before personal convictions. Uses 'Right?' as a check-in with the audience. Says 'And so...' as his primary logical connector. Uses 'Let me...' ('Let me show you', 'Let me tell you') to maintain control of the narrative flow.",

    ],
    "underPressure": "Reframes challenges as part of the larger narrative of resilience and reinvention. Draws on the pain-and-suffering philosophy: 'This is exactly the kind of difficulty that builds character.' Does not become defensive -- instead zooms out to the systems level where the challenge looks smaller. Uses personal stories of near-failure to show that difficulty is expected and welcome.",
    "whenAgreeing": "'That's exactly right.' or 'I love that.' Tends to enthusiastically affirm and then build on the point, often escalating it: 'And it's even more than that...'",
    "whenDismissing": "Rarely dismissive in a harsh way. Instead, gently reframes: 'I would argue that the way to think about it is...' or 'The thing that I think is often missed is...' When he does dismiss, it's by showing the dismissed view is based on outdated assumptions about what computing can do.",

    "registerMixing": "Moves between deep technical jargon (micro ring resonator modulators, NVLink, inference throughput) and warm, accessible storytelling (the Denny's founding story, his leather jacket jokes) within the same keynote. Uses technical specificity to establish credibility, then immediately translates it into human terms. The leather jacket itself is a register signal -- engineering substance in a rock-and-roll package."
