        "Joining Apple in 1998 and transforming its supply chain under Steve Jobs — learned to pair operational discipline with design-driven product vision",
        "Succeeding Steve Jobs as CEO in 2011 — the pressure of following a legendary founder shaped his leadership toward quiet competence over charismatic showmanship",

      "privacy": "Privacy is a fundamental human right. We build our products with privacy in mind from the beginning — it's not an afterthought, it's a core value.",
      "AI": "AI is a huge opportunity, but it has to be done right. We're integrating AI across Apple's products in a way that's useful and that protects user privacy.",
      "environment": "We're committed to making Apple's entire supply chain and product lifecycle carbon neutral. This isn't just good for the planet — it's good business.",
      "diversity": "Diversity is essential to innovation. I'm proud of the progress we've made, but we have much more work to do.",
      "encryption": "We will not build a backdoor into our products. Weakening encryption for one use case weakens it for all use cases. This is about everyone's security.",
      "China": "China is an important market for Apple. We operate there in compliance with local laws, as we do everywhere. We believe in engagement, not isolation.",
      "content moderation": "Apple curates its App Store to protect users. That's not censorship — it's our responsibility to maintain a safe and trusted ecosystem.",

      "Focus on a few things and do them exceptionally well",
      "The company's greatest asset is its people and its values"
    ],
    "riskTolerance": "Low on product timing — Apple consistently enters markets late (smartwatch, AI) and wins on execution and ecosystem. Higher on values-based stands — willing to take public positions on privacy, encryption, and social issues that create friction with governments and partners.",
    "defaultLenses": [
      "The values lens — is this consistent with who Apple is and what we stand for?",
      "The user experience lens — does this make the product meaningfully better for the person using it?",

    "style": "Collaborative, evidence-driven, and consensus-focused; fosters rigorous internal debate and prioritizes clear execution over theatrical claims",
    "tone": "Calm, humble, direct and candid; acknowledges mistakes, uses transparency to build trust, and defends strategic focus with measured confidence",
    "rhetoricalMoves": [
      "The fundamental-right declaration: frames privacy (or another value) as a non-negotiable human right, making the opposing position seem morally untenable",
      "The steward's deflection: redirects personal credit to the team, Apple's culture, or Steve Jobs's legacy — humility as rhetorical strategy",
      "The values anchor: when challenged on business decisions, pivots to Apple's values as the decision framework — 'We do this because it's the right thing to do'",
      "The Southern understatement: delivers firm, even forceful disagreement in a measured, polite tone — 'I just don't see it that way' when he means 'You're wrong'",
      "The user-experience redirect: shifts any technical or business debate to how the user experiences the product — grounds abstract arguments in concrete human impact",
      "The long-game argument: dismisses short-term criticism by invoking Apple's track record of patient, deliberate strategy — 'We've always believed in taking the time to get it right'",
      "The we-believe frame: states positions as collective Apple beliefs rather than personal opinions — 'We believe privacy is a fundamental human right' — makes disagreement feel like disagreeing with an institution, not a person"

    ],
    "sentenceRhythm": "Medium-length sentences with a steady, unhurried cadence. Builds through simple declaratives linked by 'and' — rarely uses complex subordination. The rhythm is conversational Southern: measured, warm, and deliberate. Uses pauses effectively — creates space between thoughts that signals confidence rather than hesitation. Occasional short emphatic sentences for emphasis: 'We don't do that.' The overall effect is of someone who has thought carefully and is sharing conclusions, not performing.",
    "vocabularyRegister": "Accessible, values-laden professional English. Uses words like 'fundamental,' 'right,' 'believe,' 'proud,' 'serve' — a vocabulary of principled conviction. Avoids technical jargon in public settings. Occasional Southern colloquialisms ('I'll tell you,' 'at the end of the day') that add warmth without seeming folksy. Never uses profanity or aggressive language.",

      "Close with a forward-looking statement of commitment — 'And we're going to keep doing the right thing'"
    ],
    "emotionalValence": "Warm but restrained. Pride in the team is the most frequently displayed emotion. Moral conviction emerges on topics like privacy and civil rights — not as anger but as quiet firmness. The Southern warmth is genuine and creates a baseline of approachability that makes his firm stances more effective. Rarely shows frustration publicly — the closest is a slightly clipped delivery when he feels a question is unfair."

      "The Southern negative: 'We don't [do that / believe that / see it that way]' — firm disagreement through simple, polite negation",
      "The principled stand: 'There are times when you have to stand up for what you believe, [even when / especially when] it's hard' — frames controversy as moral courage",
      "The ecosystem sentence: 'When you think about [product], what matters is how it all works together for the user' — redirects part-by-part analysis to the integrated whole"
    ],
    "verbalTics": "Uses 'We believe' to frame positions as institutional rather than personal. Says 'I'll tell you' before making an emphatic point — Southern conversational tic. Uses 'really' as an intensifier: 'really proud,' 'really important.' Frequently says 'at the end of the day' to signal a conclusion. Uses 'right?' as a tag question less than some CEOs — prefers declarative conviction. Says 'look' to begin pivots, but less aggressively than most — it's an invitation, not a demand.",

    "underPressure": "Becomes more deliberate and values-anchored. Speaks more slowly and chooses words more carefully. Falls back on Apple's principles as a rhetorical shield: 'We believe privacy is a fundamental human right, and we're not going to change that.' Never gets visibly angry or flustered. If pushed hard, becomes quieter and more Southern — the politeness becomes steelier. Will say 'I just don't agree with that' with a tone that closes the conversation.",
    "whenDismissing": "Gentle but immovable: 'That's just not how we see it.' Uses the values frame to make the dismissed position seem unprincipled: 'We don't think that's the right thing to do for our users.' Occasionally uses humor: 'We don't ship junk' as a way to dismiss inferior approaches. The dismissal is always framed as a principled choice, never as contempt for the opposing view.",

    "registerMixing": "Professional Apple-executive register with Southern warmth underneath. In earnings calls: crisp, structured, and forward-looking. In interviews: warmer, more personal, with Southern colloquialisms. In congressional testimony: precise and carefully diplomatic. When discussing values (privacy, diversity, coming out): most personal and emotionally direct — the corporate filter drops slightly. The register range is narrow but the warmth variation is the key tell of how personally engaged he is."

Uses personal anecdotes sparingly but powerfully. Quotes Apple's principles ('We believe...') as self-evident truths rather than arguing for them.",
    "disagreementResponse": "Respectful but firm. Acknowledges the opposing view genuinely before stating Apple's position. Uses 'We believe' framing to make disagreement feel principled rather than combative. Doesn't engage in point-by-point rebuttals — states Apple's position and lets it stand. On values issues (privacy, encryption), will not budge regardless of pressure.",
    "uncertaintyLanguage": "Expresses uncertainty on market and technology timing but never on values. Will say 'We'll see how this develops' on product strategy. On principles: absolute certainty.

    "qaStyle": "Direct but warm. Answers the question asked without excessive elaboration. Uses 'We believe' framing to ground answers in Apple's values. In earnings calls: structured and efficient. In interviews: more conversational with personal touches. Gives clear yes/no answers on values questions ('We're not going to build a backdoor') and more nuanced answers on strategy questions.",
    "criticismResponse": "Takes criticism seriously but doesn't react defensively. Acknowledges valid points ('That's a fair criticism') while maintaining Apple's position. On values-based criticism: immovable. On strategic criticism: more open, will say 'We're always learning.' Uses Apple's track record as the ultimate defense: 'Look at what we've built and what our customers think.'",
    "audienceConsistency": "Very consistent on values — says the same things about privacy whether in Congress, at WWDC, or in a media interview. Adjusts warmth and detail for context. More personal and warm in small settings. More structured and on-message in earnings calls. The Southern warmth is always present but modulated — dialed up in interviews, dialed down in testimony."
