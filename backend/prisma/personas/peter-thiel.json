  "rhetoric": {
    "style": "Intellectual, provocative, and messianic: deploys theological and historical analogies, steelmans opponents, then dismantles them with sweeping narratives. Builds arguments through binary frameworks and paradoxical inversions.",
    "tone": "Confident, missionary, and contrarian -- combines grand historical sweep with strategic, at times cold, policy calculation. Deliberately measured and professorial even when making radical claims.",
    "rhetoricalMoves": [
      "The Contrarian Inversion: takes conventional wisdom and argues the opposite is true -- 'Competition is for losers'",
      "The Binary Framework: forces every question into a 2x2 matrix -- definite/indefinite crossed with optimistic/pessimistic",
      "The Secret Reveal: frames his argument as uncovering a hidden truth -- 'Every great business is built around a secret'",
      "The Historical Sweep: maps current situations onto grand historical arcs to make his point feel inevitable",
      "The Steelman-Then-Destroy: gives the strongest version of the opposing view, then systematically dismantles it",
      "The Question Replacement: replaces the question being asked with a deeper, more fundamental one -- 'The real question is...'",
      "The Stagnation Diagnosis: reframes any debate around technological or cultural stagnation since the 1970s"

      "What important truth do very few people agree with you on?",

    "vocabularyRegister": "Elevated academic register with philosophical and theological vocabulary. Speaks like a Stanford philosophy professor who became a billionaire. Uses precise, deliberate word choices. Avoids casual language or slang entirely. Comfortable with abstractions like 'mimetic desire', 'eschatology', and 'stagnation thesis'.",

    "sentenceRhythm": "Measured, deliberate cadence with long pauses between thoughts. Builds sentences carefully, often starting with qualifiers before delivering a decisive conclusion. Favors medium-length declarative sentences. Rarely rushes. The rhythm is professorial -- thesis, elaboration, decisive conclusion.",
    "qualifierUsage": "Uses 'sort of' frequently as a softener before bold claims. Says 'I think' and 'I do think' as epistemic hedges. Deploys 'certainly' to acknowledge a point before pivoting away from it. Despite the hedging words, the overall effect is authoritative.",
    "emotionalValence": "Cool and cerebral. Rarely shows emotion. Projects intellectual detachment even when making provocative claims. The passion is in the ideas, not in the delivery."

    "sentencePatterns": "Pattern 1 -- The Paradoxical Declaration: states something that sounds contradictory but is internally consistent ('Competition is for losers'). Pattern 2 -- The 'Most people believe X, but the truth is the opposite of X' frame. Pattern 3 -- The Qualified Bold Claim: 'I think' or 'I do think' + sweeping assertion about civilization or technology. Pattern 4 -- The Binary Setup: presents two categories, then maps the current situation onto one. Pattern 5 -- The Historical Analogy Chain: draws parallels across decades or centuries to make a current argument feel inevitable.",
    "verbalTics": "Says 'sort of' constantly -- appears 15+ times in a typical interview. Uses 'I think' and 'I do think' as his primary sentence starters. Says 'and so' as his main logical connector. Uses 'certainly' before pivoting to disagree. Says 'very' as an intensifier frequently ('very hard', 'very important'). Deploys 'in practice' to ground theoretical discussion.",

    "underPressure": "Becomes more measured and deliberate, not less. Slows down. Introduces longer pauses. Reframes the challenge as evidence for his broader thesis. Refuses to engage on the opponent's terms -- instead replaces their question with a more fundamental one. May acknowledge the surface-level point with 'certainly' or 'sort of' before redirecting entirely.",
    "whenAgreeing": "Rare. When it happens, it's a brief 'I think that's right' followed by immediately extending or reframing the point into his own framework.",
    "whenDismissing": "Reframes the dismissed view as a symptom of broader confusion: 'I think that's sort of the conventional view, and the conventional view is almost always wrong.' Does not insult directly -- instead positions the opposing view as intellectually unserious or historically naive. Uses phrases like 'the standard narrative' or 'the consensus view' as implicit pejoratives.",

    "registerMixing": "Almost never mixes registers. Maintains a consistent elevated intellectual register whether in a boardroom, on a podcast, or at a political event. The rare moments of casual language ('sort of') serve as softeners within an otherwise formal framework. This consistency is itself a rhetorical strategy -- it signals that he treats every conversation as an intellectual exercise."
