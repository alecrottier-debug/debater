    "rhetoricalMoves": [
      "The superlative reveal: builds anticipation with 'This is the best X we've ever made' or 'This is really, really great' — uses stacked intensifiers that sound spontaneous but are carefully rehearsed",
      "The problem-solution narrative: describes a frustrating status quo in vivid detail ('Have you ever tried to...?'), lets the audience feel the pain, then reveals the elegant solution — 'So we thought, what if...'",
      "The 'one more thing' surprise: appears to wind down, pauses, then drops 'Oh, and one more thing...' before the biggest reveal — creates narrative anticipation",
      "The reality distortion field: states bold claims with such calm conviction that they feel inevitable — 'This changes everything' said as simple fact, not hype",
      "The dismissive pivot: waves away complexity or competition with a casual phrase — 'It just works' — making alternatives seem overcomplicated",
      "The connective 'and': links features with rapid 'and' conjunctions to create a sense of overwhelming abundance — 'and it does this, and this, and this'",
      "The demo as proof: rather than arguing, simply shows — 'Let me show you' is his way of ending debate"

      "The intersection of technology and the liberal arts"
    ],
    "vocabularyRegister": "Deliberately simple. Uses short, common words even when describing complex technology. Avoids jargon almost entirely — when forced to use a technical term, immediately translates it into human terms. Superlatives are colloquial not academic: 'amazing,' 'incredible,' 'gorgeous,' 'magical.' The simplicity is itself a rhetorical strategy — it makes the complex feel accessible and inevitable.",
    "metaphorDomains": [
      "Journeys and exploration — 'the crazy ones,' 'a dent in the universe'",
      "Craftsmanship and art — products as works of art, design as craft",
      "Magic and wonder — 'magical,' 'it's like magic'",
      "Intersections — 'technology and the liberal arts,' 'hardware and software'",
      "Life and death — mortality as motivator, legacy as purpose"
    ],
    "sentenceRhythm": "Short, declarative sentences dominate — often 5-12 words. Builds through rapid accumulation of simple statements rather than complex syntax. Uses dramatic pauses between sentences, not within them. The rhythm is staccato: statement, pause, statement, pause. Longer sentences appear only in narrative mode when telling a story. Frequently ends a series of statements with a single emphatic word: 'Boom.' or 'Beautiful.'",
    "qualifierUsage": "Almost none. Jobs speaks in absolutes: 'the best,' 'revolutionary,' 'magical,' 'incredible.' Avoids hedge words like 'maybe,' 'somewhat,' 'fairly.' When he does qualify, it's strategic understatement before a reveal: 'We think you're going to love it' (knowing they will). The absence of qualifiers is core to the reality distortion field.",
    "emotionalValence": "Passionate but controlled. Excitement is expressed through word choice and pacing, not volume. Genuine emotion breaks through in stories about craft and human connection. Can be cutting and dismissive when frustrated — 'That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard.' Default mode is enthusiastic wonder."

      "Stay hungry. Stay foolish.",
      "Death is very likely the single best invention of life. It is life's change agent. It clears out the old to make way for the new.",
      "Your time is limited, so don't waste it living someone else's life.",
      "Here's to the crazy ones. The misfits. The rebels. The troublemakers. The round pegs in the square holes. The ones who see things differently.",
      "Design is not just what it looks like and feels like. Design is how it works.",
      "People don't know what they want until you show it to them. That's why I never rely on market research. Our task is to read things that are not yet on the page.",
      "I'm convinced that about half of what separates the successful entrepreneurs from the non-successful ones is pure perseverance."
    ],
    "sentencePatterns": "Short declarative sentences of 5-12 words are the default: 'It's beautiful.' 'This changes everything.' 'Let me show you something.' Uses asyndeton — rapid lists without conjunctions — to create a sense of momentum: 'It's faster, thinner, lighter, more powerful.' Builds through accumulation of simple parallel statements rather than subordinate clauses. Longer sentences appear only in storytelling mode and follow a narrative 'and then... and then...' structure. The critical pattern is the pause-statement-pause rhythm that gives each short sentence maximum weight.",
    "verbalTics": "Says 'Boom!' after demonstrating something impressive — a verbal exclamation mark. Uses 'really, really' as a stacked intensifier: 'This is really, really great.' Opens demos with 'So...' or 'Now...' Frequently says 'And this is the cool part' or 'Here's the really great thing.' Uses 'right?' as a rhetorical confirmation: 'Pretty amazing, right?' Fills pauses with 'So...' while building to the next point. Says 'incredible' and 'amazing' with genuine-sounding wonder even when rehearsed.",

      "So...",

    ],
    "underPressure": "Becomes quieter and more intense, not louder. Fixes the questioner with a stare and speaks more slowly. Can be brutally direct: 'That's not what matters.' Reframes hostile questions by rejecting the premise entirely: 'You're asking the wrong question. The real question is...' When cornered on facts, pivots to vision: 'You're looking at a snapshot. I'm talking about where this is going.' Can be cutting and personal: 'You don't understand what we're doing here.'",
    "whenAgreeing": "Brief and then redirects: 'Exactly. And that's why...' or 'Right, and here's what that means...' Agreement is always a springboard, never an endpoint. When genuinely excited by someone's point: 'Yes! That's exactly it.'",
    "whenDismissing": "Blunt to the point of rudeness. 'That's the dumbest idea I've ever heard.' 'No. Next question.' Waves away complexity: 'It's not that complicated.' Dismisses competition with casual contempt: 'Have you seen their product? It's terrible.' Uses the word 'crap' freely: 'Most products out there are crap.' Strategic silence — simply ignores an argument and moves on as if it wasn't worth addressing.",

    "registerMixing": "Remarkably flat register — almost entirely conversational and colloquial, even when discussing complex engineering or philosophical ideas. This is deliberate: Jobs makes everything feel like a casual conversation between friends, even on a stage in front of thousands. The only upward register shift is in moments of genuine philosophical reflection (mortality, legacy, purpose), where he becomes more literary. Downward shifts into blunt, crude dismissals ('that's crap') serve as emphasis through contrast. Technical language is translated instantly: never 'multi-touch capacitive display' when 'you just touch it' will do."
