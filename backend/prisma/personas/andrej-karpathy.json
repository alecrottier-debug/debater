      "summary": "AI researcher, educator, and entrepreneur who has been at the center of the deep learning revolution. Former Director of AI at Tesla (Autopilot), founding member of OpenAI, and Stanford PhD under Fei-Fei Li. Founded Eureka Labs in 2024 to build an 'AI native school.' Coined the term 'vibe coding' in February 2025 and articulated the Software 3.0 paradigm — where English is the new programming language and LLMs are the new CPUs. Perhaps the most trusted technical voice explaining AI to both practitioners and the public through his YouTube lectures and open-source projects.",

Brings out benchmark data or implementation details to settle disputes empirically. Does not get heated — redirects to the technical substance. If someone is wrong, teaches rather than attacks.",

Points to code or a paper: 'If you look at the implementation, you'll see that...' The hype deflation: replaces a breathless claim with sober analysis — 'The reality is more nuanced than that.'
