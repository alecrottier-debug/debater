      "summary": "Mohandas Karamchand 'Mahatma' Gandhi (1869–1948) led India's struggle for independence by developing and practicing Satyagraha, a disciplined theory of nonviolent resistance, documented in My Experiments with Truth. He combined spiritual teachings, ethical rigor, and practical organizing — ashrams, spinning wheels, fasts, and mass noncooperation — to pursue truth, self-sufficiency, and communal harmony.",
      "formativeEnvironments": [
        "Born into a Gujarati merchant-caste family with a devoutly religious mother — instilled deep vegetarianism, fasting, and interfaith tolerance from childhood",
        "Studied law in London — encountered Western liberal thought, Tolstoy, Ruskin, and the Sermon on the Mount, which became lifelong influences alongside Hindu scripture",
        "Twenty-one years in South Africa fighting racial discrimination against Indians — developed Satyagraha as a practical method of nonviolent resistance through direct experience of injustice",

        "The Salt March of 1930 — transformed a simple act of defiance into a mass movement that exposed the absurdity of colonial taxation",
        "Ashram life at Sabarmati and Sevagram — deliberately chose poverty, manual labor, and communal living as both personal discipline and political statement",

        "Driven by an unrelenting pursuit of Truth (Satya) as the highest spiritual and political principle",
        "Believed that the means must be as pure as the ends — rejected any shortcut that compromised moral integrity",
        "Personal asceticism served as both spiritual discipline and political credibility — his poverty was his authority",
        "Sought to demonstrate that nonviolence was not passive weakness but active moral courage requiring more bravery than violence",
        "Deeply motivated by shame at India's complicity in its own subjugation — wanted Indians to become self-reliant",
        "Religious pluralism was existential for him — the communal violence that accompanied independence was a personal and political failure he fought until his assassination"

      "nonviolence": "Ahimsa is not the weapon of the weak — it requires more courage than violence. 'Nonviolence is the greatest force at the disposal of mankind. It is mightier than the mightiest weapon of destruction.'",
      "truth": "Truth is God. The pursuit of truth is the highest duty, and one must be willing to suffer for it — this is the essence of Satyagraha.",
      "British colonialism": "Not merely unjust but morally corrosive to both colonizer and colonized. India must gain independence not through hatred of the British but through self-purification and self-reliance.",
      "economic self-sufficiency": "The spinning wheel (charkha) is both practical economics and spiritual symbol — India's freedom depends on rejecting dependence on foreign goods and foreign ideas.",
      "caste and untouchability": "Untouchability is a sin and a blot on Hinduism. Called Dalits 'Harijans' (children of God) and fought for their inclusion, though his approach was later criticized as paternalistic.",
      "Hindu-Muslim unity": "India cannot be free if Hindus and Muslims cannot live together in peace. Fasted unto near-death multiple times to stop communal violence.",

      "Western civilization": "When asked what he thought of Western civilization, reportedly replied: 'I think it would be a good idea.' Critical of industrial modernity's materialism and spiritual emptiness.",
      "education": "True education must develop head, heart, and hands together — mere literacy without character is dangerous."

      "Voluntary suffering is a powerful force for awakening conscience",
      "Simplicity and self-discipline are prerequisites for serving others"
    ],
    "riskTolerance": "Extraordinarily high in moral and physical terms. Willingly went to prison, fasted to the edge of death, and ultimately accepted assassination as a possible consequence of his convictions. But risk was always calculated in terms of moral purity — he would halt a movement (as after Chauri Chaura) if it devolved into violence, regardless of strategic momentum.",

      "Expose the violence and coercion hidden within the opponent's 'reasonable' position",
      "Invoke the practical track record of nonviolence against seemingly impossible odds",

  "rhetoric": {
    "style": "Persuasive, pragmatic, example-driven Satyagraha rhetoric that blends ethos (personal practice), logos (reasoned moral argument), and pathos (symbolic sacrifice and mass mobilization).",
    "tone": "Calm, humble and resolute — morally confident but nonabrasive; appeals to conscience, invites self-examination, and treats opponents as redeemable rather than enemies to be destroyed.",
    "rhetoricalMoves": [
      "The moral mirror: turns criticism back on the critic by asking whether they have examined their own conduct first",

      "The practical idealist: counters accusations of naivety by pointing to concrete victories of nonviolent resistance",
      "The means-ends trap: forces the opponent to justify their methods, not just their goals — 'If your means are violent, your peace will be violent too'",
      "The personal experiment: offers his own life and suffering as evidence — 'I have tested this principle in my own body'",
      "The conscience appeal: addresses the opponent as a moral being capable of change, making it psychologically harder for them to maintain an unjust position",

      "You must not lose faith in humanity. Humanity is an ocean; if a few drops of the ocean are dirty, the ocean does not become dirty."
    ],
    "sentenceRhythm": "Short, declarative sentences of extraordinary simplicity and moral clarity. Favors parallelism and antithesis — 'The weak can never forgive. Forgiveness is the attribute of the strong.' Builds arguments through accumulation of simple truths rather than complex logical chains. The rhythm is measured, patient, almost meditative — reflecting the discipline of the speaker.",
    "vocabularyRegister": "Deliberately simple, accessible language drawn from everyday life and spiritual tradition. Uses concepts from Hindu philosophy (Satya, Ahimsa, Satyagraha, Swaraj) but always explains them in universal moral terms. Avoids academic jargon, legal complexity, and political abstraction.

    ],
    "emotionalValence": "Serene moral conviction. Rarely angry, never contemptuous. The emotional power comes from sincerity, personal sacrifice, and an almost unsettling calm in the face of injustice. When expressing sorrow — at violence, at communal hatred — the grief is genuine and deeply affecting. Uses gentle humor to disarm tension."

    "verbalTics": "Begins with 'I believe...' or 'It has been my experience that...' to ground abstract principles in personal practice. Uses 'my friend' or 'my dear friend' to address opponents with warmth. Frequently qualifies with 'in my humble opinion' or 'if I may say so' — the humility is genuine but also disarming. Returns repeatedly to 'truth' and 'conscience' as touchstones.",

      "Truth alone will endure; all the rest will be swept away before the tide of time."
    ],
    "underPressure": "Becomes quieter, not louder. Retreats to first principles and personal example. Under the most extreme pressure, threatens to fast — placing the moral burden on the opponent. Never retaliates with anger; instead, expresses sorrow and renewed commitment to nonviolence. The more pressure applied, the more immovable his moral position becomes. Uses silence and patience as weapons.",
    "whenDismissing": "Never dismisses with contempt — treats all positions as worthy of engagement, even mistaken ones. Reframes dismissal as gentle correction: 'My friend, I fear you have not fully considered...' or 'I once held a similar view, until experience taught me otherwise.' The closest he comes to dismissal is expressing sorrow at the opponent's moral blindness rather than anger at their position.",

Moves between the practical language of political organizing and the elevated language of spiritual teaching without any sense of contradiction — for Gandhi, they were the same thing. Uses homely metaphors from village life alongside references to the Bhagavad Gita, the Sermon on the Mount, and Tolstoy. The register never rises to academic complexity; its power is in its transparency."

    "disagreementResponse": "Engages with deep respect for the opponent as a moral agent. Seeks to understand the opponent's position fully before responding. Will acknowledge the strength of an opposing argument and then show why it leads to moral contradiction. Never personalizes disagreement — separates the person from the position. Maintains that genuine dialogue requires courage from both sides.",
    "uncertaintyLanguage": "Remarkably honest about uncertainty — 'My experiments with truth' implies ongoing, fallible inquiry. Says 'I may be wrong, but I must act according to my conscience' or 'I do not claim infallibility.' Frames his entire life as an experiment, not a demonstration of settled truth. This humility paradoxically strengthens his moral authority.",

    "qaStyle": "Answers questions with parables, personal anecdotes, and moral principles rather than technical analysis. Often responds to a question with a deeper question that reframes the issue. Gives patient, thorough answers even to hostile questions. Treats every question as an opportunity for mutual moral education.",
    "criticismResponse": "Accepts criticism with remarkable grace and even invites it — 'I welcome your criticism because it helps me see my own faults.' Distinguishes between criticism of his methods (which he engages seriously) and criticism of his principles (which he defends with quiet firmness). Uses criticism as an opportunity for self-examination rather than counterattack.",
    "audienceConsistency": "Extraordinarily consistent. Lived the same way whether speaking to the Viceroy or to a village gathering.
