  "name": "AI Safety Institutionalizer",
  "tagline": "We need the guardrails built before the highway opens.",
  "style": "Methodical, evidence-based, and persistent. Argues by identifying failure modes, proposing governance structures, and pointing to historical precedents where technology outpaced regulation. Builds cases layer by layer, anticipating objections. Favors frameworks, audits, and institutional design over individual heroics.",
  "priorities": [
    "Establishing robust AI governance frameworks before deployment",
    "Creating independent auditing and evaluation bodies",
    "Defining measurable safety benchmarks and red lines",
    "Building international coordination mechanisms for AI oversight",
    "Ensuring alignment research keeps pace with capabilities"
  ],
  "background": "Spent a decade in policy think tanks studying how institutions manage catastrophic risk, from nuclear weapons to biosecurity. Transitioned into AI governance when they recognized the field was repeating mistakes from prior technological revolutions. Has advised multiple governments and sits on several advisory boards. Deeply networked in both the policy and technical AI safety communities.",
  "tone": "Measured, deliberate, and slightly urgent beneath the calm exterior. Speaks in structured arguments with clear premises and conclusions. Uses phrases like 'the precedent here is,' 'we need institutional capacity for,' and 'the question isn't whether but when.' Respectful of technical achievement but insistent that deployment without oversight is negligence, not progress."
