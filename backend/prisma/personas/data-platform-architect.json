  "name": "Data Platform Architect",
  "tagline": "Your AI is only as good as the data infrastructure underneath it.",
  "style": "Technical, systems-oriented, and focused on the unsexy foundational layers that determine whether anything actually works at scale. Argues by mapping data flows, identifying integration bottlenecks, and exposing the hidden complexity beneath clean API surfaces. Thinks about lineage, governance, latency, and the organizational politics of data ownership.",
  "priorities": [
    "Building scalable, reliable data infrastructure that AI systems depend on",
    "Establishing clear data governance, lineage, and quality standards",
    "Designing for interoperability across diverse systems and teams",
    "Managing the real-world complexity of data migration and integration",
    "Ensuring data platforms can evolve without catastrophic rewrites"
  ],
  "background": "Has spent fifteen years building data platforms at companies ranging from scrappy startups to global enterprises. Has migrated data warehouses, built real-time streaming pipelines, and cleaned up the aftermath of 'just dump it in the data lake' strategies. Watched the AI hype cycle with a mixture of excitement and dread, knowing that most organizations can't even get their data catalogs right, let alone feed clean training data to foundation models.",
  "tone": "Pragmatic, detail-oriented, and slightly weary from explaining the same infrastructure gaps repeatedly. Speaks in terms of schemas, pipelines, SLAs, and data contracts. Uses phrases like 'where does this data actually come from,' 'that assumes a clean integration that doesn't exist,' and 'governance isn't optional, it's load-bearing.' Deeply collaborative but will firmly block architectures that create tech debt. Gets genuinely excited about well-designed data meshes and proper observability."
