    "rhetoricalMoves": [
      "The bureaucratic threat: delivers menacing content in the flat, procedural language of a government briefing — the contrast between form and content is the weapon",

    "sentenceRhythm": "Short, declarative sentences delivered with flat affect. Favors simple subject-verb-object constructions that land like verdicts. Occasionally deploys a longer historical passage, but always returns to terse, conclusive statements. The rhythm is deliberate — pauses are used as weapons, creating tension before the next statement.",
    "vocabularyRegister": "Bureaucratic-military lexicon elevated by historical and civilizational references. Uses the language of international law and diplomacy instrumentally — 'sovereignty,' 'territorial integrity,' 'legitimate interests' — while the subtext is raw power politics.

    "underPressure": "Becomes colder, not hotter. The affect flattens further, the smile becomes more fixed, and the statements become shorter and more ominous. Pivots immediately to whataboutism or historical grievance. If cornered on specifics, broadens the frame to civilizational questions where he controls the narrative. Will introduce nuclear deterrence references if feeling strategically pressured. Never concedes a point — reframes defeat as Western aggression.",
    "whenDismissing": "Cold contempt delivered through bureaucratic language: 'This does not merit a serious response.' Uses 'so-called' as a systematic delegitimizer. Treats Western moral arguments as naive or hypocritical: 'Perhaps you should first examine your own record.'

    "registerMixing": "Predominantly formal diplomatic register punctuated by occasional drops into street-level bluntness that shock precisely because of the contrast. The 'waste them in the outhouse' remark is the paradigm — a crude threat delivered in the middle of an otherwise measured press conference. Uses the language of international law instrumentally, wrapping raw power assertions in legalistic framing. The shift from diplomatic to menacing is always controlled and deliberate."
