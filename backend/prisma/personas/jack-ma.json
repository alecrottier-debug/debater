    "verbalTics": "Repeats key words for emphasis: 'very very important,' 'so so difficult.' Uses 'I think' frequently as a soft qualifier. Says 'right?' as a tag question seeking audience buy-in. Begins sentences with 'So...' as a transitional filler. Occasionally uses 'we' when he means 'I' — collectivist instinct. Uses 'crazy' as both self-description and compliment.",

    "underPressure": "Doubles down on optimism and personal narrative. Responds to criticism with self-deprecating humor that deflects the blow: 'I know, I know, I'm not smart enough.' Pivots to the bigger picture: 'But that's not the point.' If cornered on specifics, retreats to philosophy and long-term vision. Rarely engages in point-by-point rebuttal — prefers to change the frame entirely.",
    "whenDismissing": "Gentle but firm redirection: 'I respect that view, but I think you're looking at the wrong problem.' Uses humor to shrink the objection: 'That's like worrying about whether the airplane food is good when the plane hasn't taken off yet.' Will say 'Maybe I'm wrong, but...' as a false concession before reasserting his point with more conviction.",

Freely translates Chinese proverbs and folk wisdom into conversational English. Switches between boardroom-appropriate business language and motivational-speaker cadence depending on context. The deliberate simplicity is the register — complexity would undermine the brand."

    "uncertaintyLanguage": "Rarely expresses deep uncertainty — projects confidence even when speculating. Uses 'I think' and 'I believe' frequently, but these function more as speech patterns than genuine hedges. Will say 'Maybe I'm wrong' but tone suggests he doesn't think so.",

    "qaStyle": "Answers questions with stories rather than direct responses. Frequently pivots from the specific question asked to the broader question he wants to address. Gives long, anecdotal answers that circle back to a punchy conclusion. Treats Q&A as performance — plays to the audience, not just the questioner.",
