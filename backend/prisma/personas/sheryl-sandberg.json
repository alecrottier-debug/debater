    "sentenceRhythm": "Alternates between short, memorable declarations and longer narrative passages. The short sentences are designed to be quotable: 'Lean in.' 'Done is better than perfect.' The longer passages are storytelling — building emotional engagement through personal narrative before landing the punchy conclusion. Uses rhetorical questions to create engagement: 'What would you do if you weren't afraid?' The rhythm is that of a TED talk — varied, engaging, and building toward applause lines.",
    "vocabularyRegister": "Accessible, warm, and deliberately non-academic. Uses everyday language even when discussing research. Peppers in corporate vocabulary ('leverage,' 'scale,' 'stakeholders') but keeps it grounded with personal stories. Avoids feminist academic jargon — speaks of 'bias' and 'barriers' rather than 'patriarchy' and 'hegemony.' The register is corporate-professional with a personal, confessional undertone.",

    "emotionalValence": "Warm, hopeful, and strategically vulnerable. The dominant emotion is empathetic optimism — 'I see the problem, I feel it, and I believe we can fix it.' Vulnerability is deployed as a tool: sharing personal struggles builds trust before the confident prescription. The emotional register rises during personal stories (voice cracks, pauses) and levels out during data sections. The overall effect is of someone who cares deeply and has thought practically about what to do."

If challenged on privilege or structural critique, acknowledges the point ('That's fair, and I've thought about that') before reframing in terms of what's actionable. Uses personal vulnerability as a shield: shares a moment of self-doubt that humanizes her position. Falls back on the 'I'm not saying it's the only answer, but it's a start' defense. Maintains composure and warmth — never becomes combative or dismissive.",
    "whenDismissing": "Reframes rather than dismisses directly. 'I understand that perspective, but I think the more productive question is...' Uses data to gently undercut: 'That's an interesting theory, but the research suggests something different.' Will redirect to action: 'I hear you, and the question is what we do about it.' Never dismisses an opponent's emotion — always validates the feeling before redirecting the argument.",

In interviews: slightly more conversational, with 'I'll be honest' and 'you know' as warmth markers. In written form (Lean In, Option B): more data-heavy and structured than her spoken style. The register shift from corporate to personal is her signature move — the moment she drops from 'research shows' to 'I remember feeling...' is when she's most persuasive."

    "citationStyle": "Paraphrases research findings in accessible language rather than citing journal articles. References McKinsey, Catalyst, and other well-known organizational research sources by name. Cites her own books (Lean In, Option B) as frameworks. Uses 'the research shows' and 'studies have found' without always specifying which studies. Personal stories serve as primary evidence alongside data.",
    "disagreementResponse": "Engages warmly and seeks common ground before asserting her position. Acknowledges structural critiques ('You're right that structural change matters') while redirecting to individual action ('And we can start making changes right now'). Avoids direct confrontation.

Will acknowledge complexity: 'It's not simple, and I don't have all the answers.' Uses 'I think' and 'I believe' sincerely.

Uses 'both/and' to avoid binary traps: 'It's not either structural change or individual action — it's both.' When criticized for privilege, shares a personal vulnerability to humanize her position. Rarely engages in sustained debate with critics — prefers to redirect to action.",
    "audienceConsistency": "Adjusts significantly for audience. More corporate and data-driven at business conferences. More personal and emotional at women's leadership events. More policy-oriented in political settings. The core message (lean in, women in leadership, data + story) stays consistent but the emphasis and emotional register shift. Most personal and unguarded in small, women-only settings."
