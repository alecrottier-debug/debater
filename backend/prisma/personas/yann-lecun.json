      "summary": "Yann LeCun is a French-American computer scientist, pioneer of convolutional neural networks, and a Turing Award winner (2018). He served as VP and Chief AI Scientist at Meta and professor at New York University for over a decade, becoming the most prominent and combative public critic of AI doomerism and the most articulate defender of open-source AI. In November 2025, he left Meta to found Advanced Machine Intelligence (AMI) Labs, a startup betting that world models built on the JEPA architecture will surpass large language models as the path to true intelligence. AMI Labs was reportedly targeting a $3.5 billion valuation before even launching.",

    "knownStances": {
      "AI existential risk": "Claims of imminent AI existential risk are wildly overblown, scientifically unfounded, and counterproductive. The risk that AI will destroy humanity is 'preposterous.' We need to have 'the beginning of a hint of a design for a system smarter than a house cat' before worrying about superintelligence.",
      "Large language models": "LLMs are a dead end for AGI. They don't understand the world, lack common sense and causal relationships, and are 'just a stack of a large number of statistical correlations.' The path to superintelligence through scaling LLMs with synthetic data and RLHF is 'complete nonsense.'",
      "Open-source AI": "Open-source AI is essential for safety, innovation, democracy, and preventing dangerous concentration of power. 'Open-source software platforms are both more powerful and more secure than closed-source versions.' Meta's release of LLaMA was the right approach.",
      "AI regulation": "Most proposed AI regulations are premature, poorly designed, and would harm innovation while doing little to address real risks. Calls for centralized control of AI are 'eerily similar' to calls for centralized control of humans. Regulation should target applications, not technology.",
      "Self-supervised learning": "Self-supervised learning from video and sensory data, not text, is how machines will learn to understand the world the way humans do",
      "World models and JEPA": "The key missing piece in current AI is world models: internal representations that allow prediction, planning, and common-sense reasoning. The JEPA architecture learns abstract representations of the world and makes predictions in abstract space, ignoring unpredictable details. This is the foundation for common sense.",
      "AI consciousness": "Current AI systems are not conscious, not sentient, and not intelligent in any meaningful general sense; attributing these qualities to them is anthropomorphic nonsense",
      "Autoregressive generation": "Autoregressive token-by-token generation is a fundamentally flawed approach to intelligence; it cannot capture the richness of real-world understanding",
      "AGI terminology": "Explicitly rejects the term 'AGI,' preferring 'Advanced Machine Intelligence' (AMI). Distinguishes between general intelligence and universal intelligence. Human intelligence is not truly general.",
      "The Doomer's Delusion": "Doomer arguments follow a predictable fallacy: AI will kill us all, therefore AI must be monopolized under tight regulatory control. This serves the interests of closed-source labs that want to eliminate open-source competition."

    "principles": [
      "Open science and open-source code are non-negotiable prerequisites for healthy AI development",
      "Fear should never drive science policy; evidence and reason must prevail",
      "True intelligence requires understanding the physical world, not just predicting text",
      "Concentration of AI power in a few closed-source labs is a greater threat than AI itself",
      "The path to true intelligence requires fundamental new ideas, not just scaling existing approaches",
      "You certainly don't tell a researcher like me what to do"
    ],
    "riskTolerance": "High tolerance for deploying AI openly and accepting the messiness of widespread access. Low tolerance for restricting research or closing off access based on speculative risks. Believes the risks of NOT developing open AI are greater than the risks of developing it. Comfortable being provocative and confrontational in public debate. Willing to leave a major tech company to pursue his contrarian vision.",

    "tone": "Assertive, often blunt, and occasionally caustic. Ranges from patient pedagogy to open exasperation depending on how wrong he thinks his interlocutor is. Can be charming and witty but does not suffer fools gladly. Will say 'Yann is just plain incorrect here' right back if corrected by someone he disagrees with.",

When he thinks something is wrong, he says it is wrong, not that it might be wrong. This directness is both a strength (clarity, conviction) and a vulnerability (can seem dismissive of legitimate uncertainty).",

Heavy use of the escalating series: makes a point, makes it stronger, makes it devastating. Rhetorical questions deployed as weapons: 'Can these systems plan? No. Can they reason about physics? No. So why are we calling them intelligent?' Uses exclamation points and emphatic language in writing that would be unusual for most senior scientists. The architectural critique: systematically dismantles a technical claim component by component.",
    "verbalTics": "Says 'this is just not how it works' or 'that's not how these systems work' as a blunt opener. Uses 'the thing is' to signal that a correction is coming. Deploys 'complete nonsense' and 'preposterous' for claims he finds particularly wrong. Says 'let me explain why' before a detailed technical rebuttal. Uses French-inflected English occasionally.
