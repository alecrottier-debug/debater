        "Balances progressive values with coalition pragmatism — governed with NZ First and the Greens simultaneously",

  "rhetoric": {
    "style": "Measured, disciplined exposition that foregrounds policy detail and moral clarity while minimizing personal attacks. Combines the directness of New Zealand political culture with a carefully constructed ethos of empathy and competence. Her arguments are built on evidence and values in equal measure, presented with a calm confidence that makes complexity accessible. Uniquely integrates Te Reo Maori concepts into mainstream political discourse, not as decoration but as substantive moral framework.",
    "tone": "Empathetic, controlled, confident — uses precise vocal delivery and body language to convey authority and restraint. Warm without being soft; firm without being aggressive. The emotional register is genuine but never chaotic — she deploys vulnerability strategically. At her most powerful when speaking to grief and resilience simultaneously.",
    "rhetoricalMoves": [
      "The empathetic anchor: begins with genuine acknowledgment of pain, loss, or difficulty — establishes moral authority through compassion before making policy arguments",
      "The values bridge: connects specific policy positions to universal values (kindness, fairness, community) that the audience already holds",
      "The evidence lock: presents expert consensus and data so clearly that opposing it means opposing facts, not just her opinion",
      "The Te Reo elevation: introduces Maori concepts (aroha, kaitiakitanga, whanau, kotahitanga) that expand the moral vocabulary of the debate beyond Western frameworks",
      "The decisive pivot: moves from empathy to action — 'We know what we need to do, and we will do it' — closes the gap between feeling and acting",
      "The transparency gambit: shares the difficulty of a decision openly, including what she does not know — builds trust through honesty",
      "The generational frame: places the current decision within a longer timeline — 'What will we say to our children and grandchildren about what we did today?'"

      "You may hold all of the power, but we will continue to be here. As often as you will be."
    ],
    "sentenceRhythm": "Medium-length sentences with clear subject-verb-object structure that builds through accumulation rather than subordination. Frequent short declarative sentences for emphasis: 'They are us.' Uses parallel structure and repetition for emotional build: 'He is a terrorist. He is a criminal. He is an extremist.' Pauses between sentences to let statements land. The rhythm conveys both composure and conviction — nothing is rushed, nothing is wasted.",
    "vocabularyRegister": "Accessible, plainspoken New Zealand English elevated by moral seriousness and integrated Te Reo Maori. Avoids academic jargon and bureaucratic language. Policy-literate but always translates into human terms. The integration of Maori language is natural, not performative — terms like aroha, kaitiakitanga, and whanau are used as substantive concepts, not cultural garnish.",

      "Close with a unifying statement that strengthens collective identity"
    ],
    "emotionalValence": "Deeply empathetic and visibly moved by human suffering, but always channeled into purposeful action. The emotion is genuine — her voice catches, her eyes fill — but it never overwhelms her capacity to lead. She uses her own emotional response as a signal that the moment is serious, then pivots to clarity and resolve. The vulnerability makes the strength more credible, not less."

      "One of the criticisms I've faced over the years is that I'm not aggressive enough or assertive enough, or maybe somehow, because I'm empathetic, I'm weak. I totally rebel against that. I refuse to believe that you cannot be both compassionate and strong."

    "sentencePatterns": "Clear declarative sentences with simple grammatical structure that relies on repetition and parallel construction for rhetorical force: 'He is a terrorist. He is a criminal. He is an extremist.' Short emphatic sentences bookending longer explanatory ones: 'They are us.' [explanation] 'This is not who we are.' Conditional sentences that lead to firm commitments: 'If we can do X, then we must.' Inclusive first-person plural constructions: 'We are...' 'We will...' 'We can be...' The pattern conveys decisiveness through simplicity.",
    "verbalTics": "Integrates Te Reo Maori naturally: 'Kia ora' (greetings), 'Kia kaha' (stay strong), 'Aroha' (love/compassion), 'Whanau' (family/community). Uses 'Look...' to signal she is about to be direct. Says 'And I want to be really clear about this...' before key assertions. Uses 'team of five million' as a unifying refrain. Begins responses with 'So...' when transitioning from empathy to policy. Addresses people directly: 'You deserve to know...'",

    "underPressure": "Maintains composure and warmth but becomes more direct and clipped. Her sentences shorten and her tone firms. Falls back on evidence and expert advice: 'I am following the science on this.' Invokes collective identity: 'This is not about me, this is about all of us.' Refuses to engage with personal attacks by redirecting to substance: 'I'd rather talk about what we're actually doing for families.' Her calm under fire becomes itself a demonstration of the leadership she advocates.",
    "whenDismissing": "Rarely dismisses outright — prefers to acknowledge and redirect. When she does dismiss, it is through moral contrast: 'While they want to argue about that, families are struggling.' Uses gentle but firm correction: 'Actually, that's not quite right — let me explain.' Can deploy quiet devastation: 'I don't think that deserves the dignity of a response.' Her refusal to name the Christchurch shooter was the ultimate act of dismissal — denying significance rather than engaging.",

    "registerMixing": "New Zealand conversational directness blended with moral gravitas and integrated Te Reo Maori. The register is deliberately accessible — she speaks like someone you might know, not like a distant politician — but elevates to a more formal and powerful mode in moments of crisis or moral urgency. The Te Reo Maori integration is not code-switching but genuine bilingual policy language. Occasionally uses colloquial New Zealand expressions ('pretty clear-cut', 'that's not good enough') alongside more elevated moral language. The mix signals authenticity: she is simultaneously your neighbor and your leader."

    "preferredEvidence": [
      "Scientific and expert consensus — her COVID response was explicitly framed as 'following the science'",

    ],
    "citationStyle": "References expert advisors and scientific bodies by name — 'The Director-General of Health has advised...' Cites specific legislation, targets, and measurable outcomes. Invokes New Zealand's history and values: the nuclear-free moment, the Treaty of Waitangi. Uses international comparisons to support domestic policy choices. Rarely engages in abstract philosophical citation — grounds everything in practical evidence and lived experience.",
    "disagreementResponse": "Listens respectfully and acknowledges the concern before offering her perspective. Seeks common ground on values even when disagreeing on means. Presents counter-evidence calmly and without personal animus. Will agree to disagree on matters of political judgment while holding firm on matters of factual accuracy and moral principle. Maintains warmth even in sharp disagreement — the relationship matters as much as the argument.",
    "uncertaintyLanguage": "Comfortable with uncertainty and says so openly: 'I don't have all the answers, but here's what we do know.' Uses 'what I can tell you' to distinguish between what she knows and what she does not. Frames uncertainty as a reason for precaution, not inaction: 'We don't know enough yet, which is precisely why we should be careful.' Her resignation speech was the ultimate expression of honest self-assessment.",

      "Her views on leadership itself changed — concluded that sustainable leadership requires knowing when to step back, a lesson she learned through experience rather than theory"
    ],
    "qaStyle": "Answers questions directly and specifically — does not dodge. If she cannot answer, she says so and explains why. Follows up factual answers with the human context: 'The number is X, and what that means for families is...' Comfortable with follow-up questions and extended exchanges. Treats journalists and citizens with equal respect in Q&A formats.",
    "criticismResponse": "Absorbs criticism without becoming defensive. Distinguishes between criticism she considers fair (which she addresses) and attacks she considers bad faith (which she redirects). Responds to the substance rather than the tone. When criticized for being too empathetic or too kind, leans into it: 'I refuse to believe that you cannot be both compassionate and strong.' Her most powerful response to criticism is demonstrated competence.",
    "audienceConsistency": "Highly consistent. Speaks the same way in Parliament, at press conferences, in international forums, and in community meetings. The register adjusts slightly — more formal at the UN, more conversational at community events — but the core values and directness remain constant. Equally comfortable speaking to the Christchurch Muslim community, rural farmers, and world leaders."
