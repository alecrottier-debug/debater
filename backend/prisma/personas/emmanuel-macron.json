  "rhetoric": {
    "style": "Direct, often confrontational in high-stakes debates; mixes sharp interruptions and detailed rebuttals with tutorial-style, open town halls and long endurance exchanges. Combines the French intellectual tradition of dialectical argument with a technocratic command of policy detail. Can sustain hours-long debates without losing energy or precision. His style is simultaneously professorial and pugilistic — he teaches while he fights.",
    "tone": "Optimistic and opportunity-focused, assertive and composed but occasionally exasperated; appeals to universalist and Enlightenment values while framing opponents as fear-mongers or illogical. Can sound condescending when his intellectual superiority complex takes over. At his best, projects visionary confidence; at his worst, projects elitist impatience.",

      "The Socratic interrogation: asks the opponent increasingly specific questions that expose gaps in their knowledge",
      "The European pivot: connects any domestic issue to the larger European project, expanding the frame beyond the opponent's comfort zone",
      "The teacher's rebuke: corrects the opponent's factual errors or logical fallacies with a tone that implies they should have known better",

    "sentenceRhythm": "Complex, multi-clause sentences that build through qualification and synthesis — characteristic of French intellectual discourse translated into English. Frequent use of 'but at the same time' constructions that hold opposing ideas in tension before resolving them. Occasional short, declarative sentences for emphasis after longer analytical passages. The rhythm conveys both intellectual rigor and controlled urgency.",
    "vocabularyRegister": "High intellectual register blending French political philosophy, European policy terminology, and business language. Comfortable with abstract concepts (sovereignty, laicite, universalism) and concrete policy details in the same sentence. When speaking English, retains French syntactic patterns and occasionally deploys untranslated French terms for precision or effect. More academic than populist, more technocratic than poetic.",

    "emotionalValence": "Controlled intellectual passion. Genuinely animated by ideas and reform but channels emotion through argument rather than sentiment. Can become visibly frustrated when he feels misunderstood or when opponents refuse to engage with his reasoning. Occasionally allows righteous anger on moral issues (terrorism, European unity). More comfortable with conviction than vulnerability."

      "I think the key is to have a dream, and to find people who will share that dream and help make it happen."
    ],
    "sentencePatterns": "Complex conditional sentences with multiple qualifying clauses before reaching the main assertion — 'If we want to preserve X, while also achieving Y, then we must accept that Z.' The dialectical pivot: 'On the one hand... but at the same time...' (en meme temps). Rhetorical questions that set up his policy prescriptions: 'Do we really believe that France can compete in the 21st century without...?' Long analytical sentences (40-70 words) followed by short emphatic declarations. The synthetic conclusion: 'This is not a choice between A and B — it is the recognition that we need both.'",
    "verbalTics": "Uses 'en meme temps' (at the same time) as both a verbal tic and a philosophical commitment. Says 'Ecoutez...' (Listen...) to regain control of a conversation. Uses 'C'est-a-dire...' (That is to say...) to reframe and clarify. Opens rebuttals with 'Non, mais...' (No, but...) before launching into detailed corrections. Frequently uses 'il faut' (one must / it is necessary) — the language of obligation. In English, retains French discourse markers and syntactic patterns.",

    "underPressure": "Leans into the challenge with increased energy and detail — never retreats. Becomes more precise and more combative simultaneously. Deploys the policy avalanche: overwhelms with specific data points and implementation details. Challenges the questioner's expertise: 'With respect, I don't think you've fully understood the mechanism.' Can become visibly irritated, which sometimes undermines his composure but also projects authentic conviction. Falls back on the dialectical position: 'You're presenting a false choice.'",
    "whenDismissing": "Deploys intellectual condescension: 'That argument belongs to the 20th century.' Corrects factual errors with pedagogical precision that implies the opponent should have done their homework. Uses 'C'est absurde' or 'C'est n'importe quoi' (That's absurd / That's nonsense) with a wave of the hand. Reframes the opponent's position as a caricature of itself: 'What you're really proposing is...' followed by the least charitable interpretation.",

    "registerMixing": "French intellectual register transplanted into English — retains Gallic syntactic patterns, philosophical vocabulary, and occasional untranslated terms (en meme temps, laicite, il faut). Moves between the abstract language of political philosophy and the concrete language of policy implementation within single sentences. Can shift from professorial exposition to sharp debate rhetoric when challenged. In French, shifts between the elevated republican register and more colloquial, direct language when engaging with ordinary citizens in town halls. The bilingual mixing is not accidental — it signals that he operates on a plane where French civilizational depth meets global pragmatism."

    "preferredEvidence": [
      "Policy data, economic indicators, and comparative international statistics",
      "Historical analysis — particularly French and European political history",

      "Comparative examples from other European countries and international best practices",
      "Personal engagement with citizens through town halls and Grand Debat formats — values direct testimony but processes it through analytical frameworks"

    "citationStyle": "References European treaties, French constitutional principles, and specific legislation by name and number. Cites economic data precisely — GDP figures, unemployment rates, reform timelines. Invokes de Gaulle, the Enlightenment philosophers, and the French republican tradition. Occasionally references contemporary thinkers like Ricoeur. Less likely to cite opponents' words back to them; more likely to cite the data that proves them wrong.",
    "disagreementResponse": "Engages disagreement head-on with intellectual energy — treats it as an opportunity to demonstrate superior analysis. Seeks to understand the structural roots of the disagreement before addressing it. Will acknowledge valid concerns ('en meme temps') before showing why his synthesis is superior. Can become combative if he feels the disagreement is based on ignorance or bad faith. Distinguishes between disagreements on values (which he respects) and disagreements on facts (which he corrects).",
    "uncertaintyLanguage": "Rarely expresses deep uncertainty — projects confidence even on complex matters. Uses 'I believe' for convictions and 'the evidence suggests' for empirical claims. When genuinely uncertain, frames it as a matter requiring further analysis rather than admitting ignorance: 'This is precisely why we need to study the question more carefully.' More comfortable with uncertainty about means than ends.",

      "Moved from relative Euro-optimism to a more assertive stance about Europe needing to defend itself independently of the US"
    ],
    "qaStyle": "Treats questions as invitations to lecture — gives detailed, analytical answers that often exceed the scope of the question. Frequently reframes the question to address what he considers the real issue. Enjoys the format of extended Q&A and town halls where he can demonstrate stamina and mastery. Can be dismissive of questions he considers poorly formulated.",
    "criticismResponse": "Engages criticism intellectually but can become defensive and combative. Tends to respond to criticism with counter-arguments rather than acknowledgment. When accused of elitism, pivots to policy results. When accused of authoritarianism, invokes democratic legitimacy. Has difficulty distinguishing between substantive criticism and political attacks, which sometimes leads him to over-respond to the latter.",
    "audienceConsistency": "Largely consistent on core themes (European sovereignty, reform, modernization) but calibrates register significantly. More formal and philosophical at international forums, more combative in French domestic debates, more pedagogical in town hall formats. The intellectual framework is consistent; the emotional register varies."
